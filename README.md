### Tests
A range of tests have been written to aid in the development of this project, using Unreal's Automation Testing system. These can be run by selecting /Window/Testing/Test Automation/ on the top bar in the Unreal Editor. Select the application on the left, then the automation tab on the right section of the screen. You can then select and run tests. The tests I have written for this project are under 'CharPlayer', 'InputOutput2', 'WaterBallProj', and 'WaterSpout'. Try to only run a couple of tests at a time, as running too many tests may cause the editor to not respond.
